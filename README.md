# Community detection guide with igraph

Welcome to the Community Detection Guide! This repository offers an interactive journey into the fascinating world of community detection using the powerful igraph library.

This work is divided into several chapters, each designed for hands-on exploration directly in your browser via Binder. Just click the links below to launch an interactive environment and dive into the code!

### [Chapter 1: Key Concepts](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BeaMarton13/community-detection-guide-w-igraph/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Fkey_concepts.ipynb)
This chapter provides a foundational understanding of community detection in networks, explaining core concepts like nodes, edges, and what constitutes a community. It then details various metrics for evaluating community quality and offers an in-depth look at `python-igraph`'s community detection algorithms, categorizing them by approach and outlining their suitability, strengths, and weaknesses for different network types.


### [Chapter 2: Generating and Visualizing Clusters](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BeaMarton13/community-detection-guide-w-igraph/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Fgenerating_and_visualizing_clusters.ipynb)
Ready to get started with community detection? This chapter walks you through the process of generating and visualizing clusters within network data.


### [Chapter N - TODO: UPDATE IT LATER: Harry Potter Network Clustering](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BeaMarton13/community-detection-guide-w-igraph/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Fharry_potter_clustering.ipynb)
This chapter explores how real-world community detection methods, as described previously, can uncover the inherent social structures and groups formed by characters based on their interactions. By analyzing these relationships, we gain deeper insights into the organizational dynamics within the network of the wizarding universe.

### [Chapter N - TODO: UPDATE IT LATER: Les Miserables Network Clustering](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BeaMarton13/community-detection-guide-w-igraph/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Fles_miserables.ipynb)
This chapter explores how real-world community detection methods, as described previously, can uncover the inherent social structures and groups formed by characters based on their interactions. By analyzing these relationships, we gain deeper insights into the organizational dynamics within the network of [Les Miserables](https://websites.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/).
