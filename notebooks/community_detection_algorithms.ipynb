    "#### Modularity Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula defines modularity ($Q$) as a measure of the strength of division of a network into modules (or communities). It is defined to quantify the strength of community structure, by comparing the density of internal community connections to the expected density in a random network with the same degree distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i,j} \\left[ A_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \\right] \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $m$: Total number of edges in the graph (sum of all edge weights for a weighted graph).\n",
    "* $A_{ij}$: Element of the adjacency matrix, representing the weight of the edge between node $i$ and node $j$ (0 if no edge).\n",
    "* $k_i$: Degree of node $i$ (sum of weights of edges connected to node $i$).\n",
    "* $k_j$: Degree of node $j$.\n",
    "* $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$: Kronecker delta function, which is 1 if node $i$ and node $j$ belong to the same community ($c_i = c_j$), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Chapter 2](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BeaMarton13/community-detection-guide-w-igraph/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Ftest_significance_of_community.ipynb) we already saw, that a high modularity score note necessarily means a better community partitioning, e.g. in the _Grid Graph_ mentioned there.\n",

    "### __community_multilevel (The Louvain Method)__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When is community_multilevel applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is usually applied when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _You need to identify communities at different levels of granularity:_ Many real-world networks exhibit a hierarchical organization, where smaller, tightly knit groups are nested within larger, broader communities (e.g., departments within a company, friends within a social circle, or pathways within a biological system). Multilevel algorithms can reveal these nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Dealing with large-scale networks:_ It is computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for analyzing networks with millions of nodes and edges, where other community detection methods might become prohibitively slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On What Kind of Graphs is It Applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "Community multilevel algorithms are primarily applied to  __unweighted__ or __undirected and weighted__ graphs. While they can be adapted for directed graphs, their core principle of optimizing connections within groups is most directly applicable to networks where relationships are reciprocal or symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are particularly effective for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Sparse graphs:_ Networks where nodes are not extensively connected to every other node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Real-world complex networks:_ These algorithms are robust enough to handle the complexities and irregularities often found in real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "### __community_leiden__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leiden algorithm is a community detection algorithm that builds upon the foundations of the Louvain method but addresses some of its crucial shortcomings, particularly the issue of disconnected or poorly connected communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When is community_leiden applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leiden algorithm is applied in similar scenarios to Louvain, but it is often preferred when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Guaranteed Connected Communities are Crucial:_ If it's essential that the identified communities are internally connected graphs (meaning all nodes within a community can reach each other through paths within that community), Leiden is the algorithm of choice. Louvain can sometimes produce disconnected communities, especially after multiple aggregation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Higher Quality Partitions are Desired:_ Research has shown that Leiden generally produces partitions with higher modularity values and is more stable in its results compared to Louvain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Analyzing Large and Complex Networks:_ Like Louvain, Leiden is designed for scalability and efficiency on large networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Addressing the \"Resolution Limit\" (to some extent):_ While both Louvain and Leiden optimize modularity, and modularity itself has a resolution limit (it tends to favor larger communities), Leiden's refinement step can help mitigate this by ensuring that smaller, truly cohesive sub-communities are not artificially merged into larger, poorly connected ones. Some implementations of Leiden also allow for a _resolution_parameter_ (often denoted as γ) to explicitly control the granularity of the communities detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - γ > 1: Leads to more, smaller, and well-connected communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 0 < γ < 1: Leads to fewer, larger, and potentially less well-connected communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### On What Kind of Graphsis It Applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Louvain, Leiden is primarily applied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Undirected graphs:_ Although adaptations for directed graphs exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Weighted or unweighted graphs:_ The algorithm can easily incorporate edge weights to reflect the strength of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Sparse to dense networks:_ It performs well across a range of network densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Real-world complex networks:_ Its robustness and guarantees make it suitable for noisy and irregular real-world data.\n",

    "### __community_fasgreedy__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When is community_fasgreedy applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast-Greedy is typically applied when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _You need a quick initial pass at community detection:_ It's known for its relatively fast performance, especially on sparse graphs. This makes it a good \"first try\" algorithm when exploring a network's community structure, particularly for larger graphs where more computationally intensive methods might be too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Modularity maximization is the primary goal:_ The algorithm is explicitly designed to optimize the modularity score, aiming to find partitions where connections are dense within communities and sparse between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Hierarchical insights are valuable:_ As an agglomerative method, it produces a dendrogram (a hierarchical tree of merges). This can be useful for visualizing how communities are formed and potentially exploring community structures at different levels of granularity (though often the partition with the highest modularity is selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Baseline comparison:_ Due to its historical significance and speed, it's often used as a baseline algorithm to compare the performance and results of newer, more complex community detection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### On What Kind of Graphs is It Applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Louvain, Leiden is primarily applied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Undirected Graphs:_ The original algorithm and its most common implementations work on undirected networks. While some adaptations might exist for directed graphs, its core modularity definition is most naturally applied to undirected connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Weighted or Unweighted Graphs:_ It can handle both. If edges have weights, these weights are incorporated into the modularity calculation, allowing the algorithm to account for the strength of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Sparse Graphs:_ The algorithm's efficiency is particularly notable on sparse graphs, where the number of edges is much less than the maximum possible. This is common in many real-world networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### __community_voronoi__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When is community_voronoi applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Community Voronoi Algorithm is typically applied when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Dense networks:_ While many community detection algorithms struggle with dense graphs due to high computational costs, Community Voronoi remains tractable and effective, particularly when edge weights play a more crucial role in defining the optimal community structure of the network then the topoly itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Consistency and robustness are key:_ Many community detection algorithms are stochastic and may produce different outputs on the same input. Community Voronoi, when initialized with fixed seed nodes, provides consistent and reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Attribute handling (strength or length):_ The algorithm can easily handle attributes such as strength or length, or even both.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### On What Kind of Graphs is It Applied?\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Undirected or Directed Graphs:_ The algorithm is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Weighted or Unweighted Graphs:_ It can handle both weighted and unweighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Sparse or Dense Graphs:_ A key strength of the algorithm is its ability to effectively handle dense graphs, which are frequently encountered in real-world networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Real-world complex networks:_ The algorithm is robust enough to manage the complexities and irregularities often found in real-world data.\n",
